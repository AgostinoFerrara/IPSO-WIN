=================================Source code by Agostino Ferrara(c)==

Windows version   

This is a restored version of the IPSO V.2.1 program,   
developed in 1988-90.  It is NOT an update, so the beaviour   
of the original version have been deliberately retained.   

==============================================================  
IPSO was written in GW-Basic 1.1    
The compiler used for this WIN executable is QB64 v2.0.2:    
https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/releases      

IPSO is an 'executable' and could be seen by windows as a   
potential threat to its intergrity, so it could be blocked,   
depending of your system configuration.   
  
==============================================================   
Although I suggest placing the folder IPSO in the program folder,     
it should work from anywhere. Data files in the IPSO directory    
are easier to manage if you are not confident with command-line    
commands.  When prompted, enter the name DATI (without the    
extension) to open the enclosed DATI.IPS example file.    
  
xxxxx.IPS files use a comma separated values format with an      
information header. Look at DATI.IPS to built similar files     
through any text editor or read the enclosed file 'How to     
import data from excel'.      
  
Printer outputs are not anymore working.   
   
In the install folder you'll also find the original paper with    
the use and the description of functions and program. It is     
still in Italian,  as well as the software......
