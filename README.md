=================================Source code by Agostino Ferrara(c)==

Windows version   

This is a restored version of the IPSO V.2.1 program,   
developed in 1988-90.  It is NOT an update, so the beaviour   
of the original version have been deliberately retained.   

==============================================================  
IPSO was written in GW-Basic 1.1    
The compiler used for this WIN executable is QB64 v2.0.2:    
https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/releases      

IPSO is an 'executable' and could be seen by windows as a   
potential threat to its intergrity, so it could be blocked,   
depending of your system configuration.   
  
==============================================================   
I suggest to put the folder IPSO in the user directory but   
it should work from anywhere. Data files that are in the same   
directory of IPSO are easier to manage if you are not confident   
with command-line commands. To open the enclosed  DATI.IPS    
example file, input, when asked, the name without extension.   
  
xxxxx.IPS files use a comma separated values format (use   
DATI.IPS as reference to copy and paste other datasets with    
a simple text editor). Be sure to store data files as simple    
plain text (so set this in text editor preferences).   
  
Printer outputs are not anymore working.   
   
In the install folder you'll also find the original paper with    
the description of the program and its use. It is still in   
Italian,  as well as the software......
