Windows version

This is a restored version of the IPSO V.2.1 program, 
developed in 1988-90.  
It is NOT an update. 
The beaviour and feeling of the original version have been deliberately 
retained.

==============================================================

The compiler used for the WIN executable is QB64 v2.0.2:

==============================================================

I suggest to put the folder IPSO in the user directory but 
it should work from anywhere, hopefully. Data files that are 
in the same directory of IPSO are easier to manage if you are 
not confident with command-line commands. To open the enclosed  
DATI.IPS file, input, when asked, the name without extension.

 xxxx.IPS files use a comma delimited format(use DATI.IPS as 
reference to copy and paste other datasets through a simple 
text editor (i.e. Notepad). 

Printer outputs are not anymore working.

In the install folder you'll also find the original paper with 
the use and the description of functions and program. It is 
still in Italian,  as well as the software......

The use of this software is completely free by citing the
